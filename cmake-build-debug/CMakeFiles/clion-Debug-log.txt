CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:23 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "GTest" with any of
  the following names:

    GTestConfig.cmake
    gtest-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "GTest" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "GTest_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "GTest"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
